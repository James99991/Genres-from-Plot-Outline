    "- The first one (dubbed PT1) subjectively or randomly selects one of the multiple labels of each multi-label instance and discards the rest, while the second one (dubbed PT2) simply discards every multi-label instance from the multi-label data set. \n",
    "- These two problem transformation methods discard a lot of the information content of the original multilabel data set and are therefore not considered further in this work.\n",
    "- The third problem transformation method that we will mention (dubbed PT3), considers each different set of labels that exist in the multi-label data set as a single label. \n",
    "    - One label for sports, one for sports and politics, one for science and politics etc\n",
    "- The **most common** problem transformation method (dubbed PT4) learns |L| binary classifiers Hl: X → {l, ¬l} , one for each different label l in L. It transforms the original data set into |L| data sets Dl that contain all examples of the original data set, labelled as l if the labels of the original example contained l and as ¬l otherwise. It is the same solution used in order to deal with a single-label multiclass problem using a binary classifier. \n",
